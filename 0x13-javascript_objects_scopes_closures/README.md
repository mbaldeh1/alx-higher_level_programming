                  0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures
================================================================================


In JavaScript, objects, scopes, and closures are fundamental concepts that play crucial roles in the language. Let's explore each of these concepts in more detail:

Objects:
Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs, where values can be of any data type, including functions. Objects can be created using object literal syntax or by using the new keyword with a constructor function.

Scopes:
Scopes in JavaScript determine the accessibility or visibility of variables and functions. JavaScript has function scope and block scope.
Function Scope: Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function.

Block Scope: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), block scope allows variables to be scoped to blocks enclosed in curly braces {}. Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped.

Closures:
Closures are functions that have access to variables defined in their outer lexical environment, even after the outer function has finished executing. They "remember" the environment in which they were created. Closures are created whenever a function is defined within another function. 

Closures are often used to create private variables and encapsulation in JavaScript.

Understanding objects, scopes, and closures is essential for effective JavaScript programming and enables you to write more modular and maintainable code.
